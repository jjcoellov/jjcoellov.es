My name is **Juan Jos√© Coello**, although everyone calls me **Juanjo**. You can find me on Internet as [@jjcoellov][twitter]. I'm a half Venezuelan / half Spanish Software Engineer working in **[Intuit][intuit]** as an Engineer Manager, creating software for Small Business to help them become more productive and successful. Previously, I worked in a small startup called **Acrede** (acquired by Intuit) and the by-that-time Spanish social network **[Tuenti][tuenti]**. My full professional profile can be found through [LinkedIn][linkedin].

I have lived in Caracas (Venezuela), Tenerife (Spain), Barcelona (Spain), Jersey (Channel Islands) and London (United Kingdom). Since September 2019 je suis un habitant de Paris.

I have been blogging on and off (mostly off) for about 15 years now. If there is a theme that describes my blogging style has been "inconsistent". Most of my articles are written *en la lengua de Cervantes*, but I decided to switch to English as many friends are anglophones. If you dig a bit on the [Archive](/archive) you can find most of the articles written in Spanish.

All the old articles I am now pretty ashamed of are not in this blog anymore, but you can still find them in [GitHub][github]. It is a humbling experience to go back and ready again what I thought it was Pulitzer's material back at the time.

I am not even close to write in French, but time will tell *(most likely, it will not tell, and I will fail miserably, really, but I am a short-term pessimist and a long-term optimist)*.

I am mostly interesting in Business and Engineering Management, Technology, Finances and Productivity, although those interests have evolved (for good or bad) over time. Also, I am lucky enough to have met really amazing [people][toni] that I interview from time to time.

I continuously try to beat [procrastination][wbw], with mixed results so far. Keep trying, though.

You can reach me through **hola** **[AT]** **jjcoellov.es** or through my [twitter][twitter] account .
