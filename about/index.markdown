My name is **Juan Jos√© Coello**, although I prefer you call me **Juanjo**. You can find me on several places on Internet as [@jjcoellov][twitter] and I'm a half Venezuelan / half Spanish Software Engineer working in [Acrede][acrede], a globall payroll solution company. Previously I worked in [Tuenti][tuenti]. My full professional profile can be found through [LinkedIn][linkedin].

I have lived in Caracas (Venezuela), Tenerife (Spain), Barcelona (Spain) and now I'm living in a small but cozy island called Jersey (Channel Islands). I used to blog in spanish, but then I switched to english as many friends are anglophones. If you dig a bit on the [Archive](/archive) you can find some articles yet written in spanish.

I'm mostly interesting in Technology and Productivity, but I blog about everything I find curious. I'm also lucky enough to have met really amazing [people][toni] that I interview from time to time. 

You can reach me through **hola** **[AT]** **jjcoellov.es** or through my [twitter][twitter] account . 

Aprendo, aprendo, aprendo...
