My name is **Juan Jos√© Coello**, although everyone calls me **Juanjo**. You can find me on Internet as [@jjcoellov][twitter]. I'm a half Venezuelan / half Spanish Software Engineer working in **[Intuit][intuit]** as an Engineer Manager, creating software for Small Business to help them become more productive and successful. Previously, I worked in a small startup called **Acrede** (acquired by Intuit) and the by-that-time Spanish social network **[Tuenti][tuenti]**. My full professional profile can be found through [LinkedIn][linkedin].

I have lived in Caracas (Venezuela), Tenerife (Spain), Barcelona (Spain), Jersey (Channel Islands) and London (United Kingdom). Since September 2019 je suis un habitant de Paris. Most of my articles are written *en la lengua de Cervantes*, but I decided to switch to English as many friends are anglophones. If you dig a bit on the [Archive](/archive) you can find most of the articles written in Spanish. I am not even close to write in French, but time will tell. 

I am mostly interesting in Business and Engineering Management, Technology, Finances and Productivity, although those interests have evolved (for good or bad) over time. Also, I am lucky enough to have met really amazing [people][toni] that I interview from time to time.

I continuously try to beat [procrastination][wbw], with mixed results so far. Keep trying, though.

You can reach me through **hola** **[AT]** **jjcoellov.es** or through my [twitter][twitter] account .
